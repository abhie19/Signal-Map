#SIGNAL MAP

## INTRODUCTION

As the modern era proceeds, people inevitably tend to keep their smartphones with them all the time, which gives any application to reach out to the masses very easily and impact their lives. Majority of the people who are engaged in some kind of business tend to travel a lot which makes them go in and out of the area in the reach of their corresponding network providers. Because of this, there are constant glitches and cut offs during an ongoing conversation on the phone. The only way to eradicate this constant problem is to help them find a reliable network and thatâ€™s what we aim at doing. There have been a lot of cases at airports, railway stations, during travels or even at home where people inadvertently go out of the reachable zone and hence the connection goes down. By the help of our application they could know where exactly they got to be when they want a completely uninterrupted conversation.

The similar problem persists with the Wi-Fi signals perhaps because of the inability of the router to reach to a wider area or due to the various obstacles that come in the way. This leads to interruption in various online facilities and most importantly while making important transactions over the internet. In order to deal with such a scenario the user needs to figure out the location where he/she needs to be to carry on with a reliable connection.


## WORKING

- The application starts with the user tapping on the app icon to reveal the welcome page. 
- The user can then select the type of network (Cellular or WIFI) he/she wants to work with. 
- Now user can see his/her location on the map along with network information such as- Carrier Name, Network Strength, Network Type.
- If the user wants to update his details to the server, he/she can select the appropriate option. Otherwise, user may select option to get the SIGNAL MAP of his/her surrounding. 
- This SIGNAL MAP will indicate the places nearby users location on the Google Map interface with markers representing - Strong, Medium or Weak Signal Strengths.
- The smart trick here is that, in case user loses his/her signal completely, the app will still be able to show the SIGNAL MAP since we have designed the application to fetch some data as soon as the users network strength goes below 10%.
